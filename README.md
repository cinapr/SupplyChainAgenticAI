# "SupplyChainAgenticAI" - Food Supply Chain Resilience Agent (LangChain + LangGraph)

A multi-agent system that monitors a food supply chain, detects disruptions, and autonomously decides on replenishment actions. 
It monitors food supply chain nodes, detects  disruptions (climate shocks, stock failures), and autonomously  generates replenishment recommendations.

Free tools: LangChain + Ollama (runs LLM locally, completely free, no API key needed)



## Research Context

Built to explore agentic AI approaches to supply chain resilience — relevant to EU food security research (e.g. CARES project framework).





## Food Supply Chain Resilience: Agentic AI & Simulation

This repository contains a proof-of-concept exploring how food supply chains can autonomously adapt to severe climate and geopolitical disruptions. The project combines traditional discrete-event simulation with modern, privacy-preserving agentic AI to monitor, model, and manage supply chain shocks.

It is built specifically to explore autonomous adaptation frameworks relevant to food security research and complex systems engineering.






## Technologies

- LangGraph (multi-agent orchestration)
- LangChain + Ollama (local LLM, no cost)
- Python, Pandas




## Project Architecture

How the data flow? ```Monitor Agent → Replenishment Agent → Report Agent```

- **Monitor Agent**: Scans all supply chain nodes, flags critical stock levels
- **Replenishment Agent**: Recommends actions (reroute, emergency restock, etc.)
- **Report Agent**: Synthesises executive summary for decision-makers

The repository is divided into two distinct modeling approaches:

### 1. Autonomous Agentic AI (`/agent`)
A multi-agent system designed to monitor logistics data, detect critical disruptions, and propose immediate replenishment strategies. 
* **Local & Private:** Runs entirely locally using Ollama. This ensures sensitive enterprise supply chain data never leaves the local machine.
* **LangGraph Orchestration:** Utilizes a three-node agent graph:
  * **Monitor Agent:** Scans inventory data to identify nodes critically low on days-of-stock.
  * **Replenishment Agent:** Evaluates disruptions and prescribes specific actions (e.g., rerouting, emergency restocks, activating backup suppliers).
  * **Report Agent:** Synthesizes the data into a rapid executive summary for decision-makers.

### 2. Complex Systems Simulation & Analysis (`/simulation`)
A physical simulation of a 3-node food supply network (Farms → Warehouse → Distribution Center → Consumers) facing a severe climate shock.
* **AnyLogic Physics:** Models the physical reality of inventory flow, queue bottlenecks, and transit delays. We simulate normal operations, introduce a production crash at time=30, and trigger automated backup recovery at time=45.
* **Python Aggregation:** Reads the exported simulation data, aligns the time-series variables, and plots the inventory curves to visualize the impact of different disruption severities.
* **R Statistical Modeling:** Applies Kruskal-Wallis tests and linear models to the simulation output to statistically quantify the relationship between disruption severity and recovery time.
